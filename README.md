## Custom Indicator: PositioningLines()
The `PositioningLines()` function is responsible for market structure analysis and drawing positioning lines on the chart. This function should be customized according to the specific market analysis requirements.

## Initialization: OnInit()
The `OnInit()` function is called once when the EA is loaded onto the chart. It initializes the trade object, subscribes to the symbol and timeframe, and calls the `PositioningLines()` function.

## Trading: OnTick()
The `OnTick()` function is called on every tick and contains the code for the Fimath strategy and automatic trading. This is where the trading logic should be implemented.

## Deinitialization: OnDeinit()
The `OnDeinit()` function is called once when the EA is removed from the chart. It is responsible for any necessary deinitialization code.

## Main Function: OnStart()
The `OnStart()` function is the main function of the EA and is currently empty. It can be used for additional customizations if needed.
